# 6502-Project

ALOHA and welcome!

This is another one of my projects (more on the hardware side of things). I used this project to help me understand computers at a lower level and just a project I did in my free time.

While highly inspired by Ben Eater's 6502, there are a few things I added on my own (more to come...) to my own 6502 that I thought would be good enough to post on github.

Some of the features include:  
  1. 6502 initialization code (Registers, I/O, RAM, ROM)
  2. Added memory mapped RAM, ROM and VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter)
  3. Added Versatile Interface Adapter for I/O with user and other peripheral devices
  4. Developed priority interrupts so the 6502 doesn't have to poll each device when an interrupt is signaled

There are many more things I'm looking forward to develop on the 6502 so stay tuned!

Enjoy your day and take care!!!
